# Eco_Commute

Our project, Eco Commute aims to revolutionise the urban mobility in Australia by taking Victoria as a starting point and creating an integrated, data-driven system that prioritises sustainable transport over the use of private vehicles. 
It leverages the use of analysis, behavioural insights, ‘cutting-edge technology’ and innovative policies to build a connected urban environment where public transport, cycling, walking and electric mobility are the default modes for the citizens. It paves the way to create a more sustainable and liveable city in line with Victoria’s zero emissions goal by 2045
